- `q` or `escape`: quit
- digit, `.`, or `e`: type a number in the input (`e` for e-notation)
- `#` enter radix mode
- `backspace`
	- if the input is selected and not empty, drop the last char

	- else, drop the expression to the left of the selection
- `enter` or `space`: push the input to the stack
- `+`: add
- `-`: subtract
- ``: multiply
- `/`: divide
- `` ` ``: reciprocal
- `~`: opposite (by analogy to Vim's `~`)

- `>`: move selected expression to the right (by analogy to Vim's `>>`)
- `<`: move selected expression to the left (by analogy to Vim's `<<`)
- `right`: swap the selected expression (or the topmost one) with the expression to its left
- `a`: cancel selection and jump to input (by analogy to Vim's `A`)
- `:`: enter command mode (by analogy to Vim's `:`)
- `|`: enter pipe mode
    - any char: type a command (to be executed directly, not through your `$SHELL`)
